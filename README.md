AI, Deep learning and emerging trends in software development

The Game, Briefly:
I was tasked with creating a game where a pirate agent (computer) would find treasure in a maze where some squares were open and others were walls. 
The idea was to get the shortest path and learn the maze to obtain a win percentage of 100% I started with code given to me to load the Keras 
files and provide librraries to the algorithms that computed the values needed to record each episode and learn. I then created the code to 
set the initial position of the agent and test random squares, determine which moves had the best reward, and save the episodes to use for exploitation 
after a certain number of explorations. Then, I executed code to determine the loss function and evaluate the moves taken by the agent.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are problem solvers. From understanding the problem and the desired solution, they learn and plan to solve the problems programatically.
By doing so, we have been able to do things like go to the moon, diagnose illnesses with great accuracy, and perform tasks at great percision that humand cannot achieve. 
This is important. Every day new technologies are introduced to make our lives easier. Even if a computer scientist isn't creating new things, they have the ability
to maintain existing technologies and improve on those. If we continue to make great strides, computer scientists will be at the helm of creating a world where
mistakes are reduced by a significant amount where it matters, such as in surgery or when operating dangerous equipment such as airplanes or cars.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach a problem first by understanding what the problem is and what the desired outcome of a solution would be. Then I research the technologies that I would need
in terms of solving those problems. For example, Python has excellent libraries to help handle, parse, interpret, and display data where Java is much better for handling 
objects and generating secure, fast code that might need to run on any platform. Knowing now only what language to use, but what specific needs an end user has will 
determine how the problem gets solved. Then it's time to go to paper. A professor once told me that before I type even one line of code, I need to design on paper.
Once that design is completed, the code will write itself. Then, end user testing ensues and anything that isn't working correctly is edited and fixed.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I owe manking the privacy they deserve. When doing business with people, securing personal information is of utmost importance. I promise to always treat other
people's data as if it were mine and protect it. 

Bias is also a concern. It is easy to have bias enter your work when you don't have enough representation from various groups of people. To ensure bias is reduced,
it is important to ask yourself and your team, is there any one that isn't appropriate represented here? If not, fix that.

Whatever I do, my intention is to produce the least amount of harm possible, and I intend to always follow that principle in everything I do.
